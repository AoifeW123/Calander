## Calender

### I. Initiative

This Project is a command line, text based calendar program. This calander program will be able to read and write calander entries; these files come from a text file. This calander will be able to show any entries made in a clear format, create new text files- storing them as entries and allow the user to edit any entries made.

### II. Epics and User Stories

Epics


#### Non-Functional Requirements

Asthetic or non essential requirements

#### User Stories

As a user, I would like to be able to retrieve my files and view them in a clear format.

As a user, I would like to be able edit these files that I have retrieved.

As a user, I would like to create new files that can be stored and retrieved in the future.

As a user, I would like to have the calander format the text into a readable structure.

#### How We Addressed The Requirements

How will your planned product meet the user requirements.

### III. Genre

This is a simple calander that is considered a utility, as it isn't any form of game.

### IV. Technical Details

#### Platform

Programming Language/Enviroment#

Programming Challenges

State the programing challenges you are trying to overcome

#### Constructing And Implementing My Code

Think of this as the method. How will you go about building your program?

#### Algorithms

Explanation of the algorithms behind your program


#### Coding Standards

The standards of code that will be used need to be harmonised, consistent and in a coherent style. The coding standards that are fundental are the Good Basic Standards. These will be used to the best ability. The main focus are on:

The layout of the code.

The name of the functions and variables are strutured well.

Making sure that the code is readable and is understood, through the use of spelling and capitalisation 

Adding comments to the code so that each section is detailed on the use of it.
